# Banana Mania Randomizer!

This tool requires [`SMBBM Course Modifier`](https://gamebanana.com/tools/9723) to work it creates a .json file for use with this mod!

The Banana Mania Randomizer is a customizable randomization program that allows for custom difficulties to be created!

A list of current features includes:
- Picking from every single collection of levels in Banana Mania, excluding Golden Banana and Dark Banana. Those levels do not work outside of their original modes.
  - This now includes the unused "Challenge Mode" variants of 4 Original Stage Mode stages!
- Customizable Warp Goals! Pick how far forward Green and Red goals will send you!
- A custom level count! Don't feel like playing all of the levels, but want to pull from every single collection? Set a limit to how many levels your course will have!
- A Seeding system, allowing for synchronization of custom difficulties for racing others! 
- Choice in what normal difficulty your custom difficulty will overwrite!
- The creation of custom Extras, making your difficulty divided between normal stages and extra stages!
- Duplicate stages! Feeling lucky? Turn this on and hope you don't get Chaos 10 times in a row!
- Removal of Bonus Stages!
- Cursed and Super Cursed: Only one goal per level will send you forward! 

The `.json` file writes to the same location as the executable, and the course in-game is always **SMB2 Marathon**.

Feel free to add suggestions through Issues, report problems, or contribute directly with Pull Requests!

Also please be nice to me, I learned Python to make this I know it's messy it's my first attempt at actual coding
