# Banana Mania Randomizer!

This tool requires [`SMBBM Course Modifier`](https://gamebanana.com/tools/9723) to work it creates a .json file for use with this mod!

The Banana Mania Randomizer is a customizable randomization program that allows for custom difficulties to be created!

A list of current features includes:
- Picking from every single collection of levels in Banana Mania, excluding Golden Banana and Dark Banana. Those levels do not work outside of their original modes.
- Customizable Warp Goals! Pick how far forward (**OR BACKWARD**) Green and Red goals will send you!
- A custom level count! Don't feel like playing all of the levels, but want to pull from every single collection? Set a limit to how many levels your course will have!
- A Seeding system, allowing for synchronization of custom difficulties for racing others! 

Feel free to add suggestions through Issues, report problems, or contribute directly with Pull Requests!
